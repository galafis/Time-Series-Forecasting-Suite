- Helps users choose the best model for their data

#### 3. Example Datasets
- `sales_data.csv`: Retail sales with seasonal patterns (2022-2024)
- `temperature_data.csv`: Weather data with climate trends (2020-2024)
- `stock_price_data.csv`: Financial data with realistic volatility (2021-2024)
- Comprehensive README in examples/ directory
- Ready-to-use datasets for testing and demonstration

#### 4. Enhanced Metrics Display
- Metrics now displayed in formatted table instead of raw dictionary
- Cleaner, more professional presentation
- Easier to read and interpret

### Testing Enhancements

#### Expanded Test Suite (4 → 13 tests)
- `test_load_data`: Basic data loading
- `test_load_custom_data`: Custom CSV with different column names
- `test_create_features`: Feature engineering validation
- `test_analyze_components`: Time series decomposition
- `test_train_models`: Model training verification
- `test_metrics_values`: Metrics validation and sanity checks
- `test_forecast`: Basic forecasting for all models
- `test_forecast_different_horizons`: Multiple forecast horizons
- `test_forecast_without_training`: Error handling
- `test_create_forecast_plot`: Visualization creation
- `test_create_components_plot`: Components visualization
- `test_split_data`: Data splitting functionality
- `test_data_preprocessing`: Missing value handling

#### Test Coverage
- 100% pass rate (13/13 tests)
- Edge cases covered
- Error handling validated
- All models tested
- Visualization creation verified

### Documentation Improvements

#### README.md Enhancements
- ✅ Real application screenshots (replaced placeholders)
- ✅ Detailed usage examples (web UI and programmatic)
- ✅ CSV data format requirements and examples
- ✅ Comprehensive troubleshooting section
- ✅ FAQ section with common questions
- ✅ Performance benchmarks and considerations
- ✅ Complete bilingual documentation (English/Portuguese)

#### New Documentation
- `examples/README.md`: Guide for example datasets
- Inline code documentation improvements
- Better function docstrings

### Configuration Updates
- Added pytest to requirements.txt
- Updated .gitignore to include example CSV files
- Removed image restrictions for examples

### Performance Validation
- All models train successfully
- Forecast generation works for all time horizons (1-365 days)
- Memory usage optimized
- No performance regressions

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Quality**: 100% PEP8 compliant
- **Test Coverage**: 13 comprehensive tests, 100% pass rate
- **Documentation**: Complete bilingual docs with screenshots
- **Functionality**: All features working end-to-end
- **User Experience**: Enhanced with export, comparison, and examples

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
No breaking changes! All existing functionality preserved. New features are additions:
- Export buttons appear automatically after forecast generation
- Model comparison appears when multiple models are trained
- Example datasets are optional resources

### For Developers
- Import structure unchanged
- API compatibility maintained
- New optional features can be safely ignored
- Tests can be run with: `python3 -m pytest test_forecasting_suite.py -v`

## Future Enhancements Considered

### Potential Future Features
- Batch processing for multiple time series
- Custom model parameters in UI
- Additional forecasting algorithms (Prophet, LSTM)
- Confidence intervals for forecasts
- Anomaly detection
- Automated model selection
- REST API for programmatic access

### Performance Optimizations
- Caching for repeated forecasts
- Parallel model training
- Incremental data updates
- GPU acceleration for large datasets
